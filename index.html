    <p>This project is aimed at solving the ease of customer support with a click of a button. As a professional in the
         financial sector in my country, I know and entirely relate to the customers' hustle to get information about a
          certain product or service. In banks, microfinance, and SACCO organizations, customers are used to queuing in
           the service halls to get solutions to their issues, mostly accounts and transactions. I really see this as a
            challenge to the corporate financial institutions and the economy as a whole. In this digital era, where more
             than half of the youth, who by the way make the largest age group that transact digitally, have email addresses
              and smartphones, it pains me a lot that they have to go to these institutions just for enquiries or issues that
               would otherwise be easily solved with a button click.</p>
    <p>With Custopedia, clients are able to ask questions online and get real-time answers, and even go ahead and raise
         a ticket to lodge a service request, a complaint, or a detailed query custom-tailored to the department that
          is going to handle the issue satisfactorily, customers can cut to the chase and get help without having 
          to visit the physical offices. Likewise, the companies involved are able to divert more of their time to the
           development and improvement of service delivery rather than being overwhelmed by serving queueing
            customers on a daily basis.</p>
